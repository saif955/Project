Recently I tutored a student who was preperaing for his O levels. That peaked my interest in the teaching profession and
even though I do not want to become a teacher professionally but doing it part time is what I am interested in.

<Big><p style="color:rgb(11, 11, 137)">About Me:</p></Big>
I joined Manarat Dhaka International School when I was three years old. My academic life began rather early and during my academic life I have also participated in many 
extra curriculum activities such as sports, chess tournaments and even debates. Currently I am studying in NSU as an UnderGrad Student and I am learning computer science and engineering.
and completed my O Levels(2016-2017) and A levels(2017-2019) from that institution.
I have always been very enthusiastic about space and I even wanted to pursue Astrophysics both academically and professionally but for now
I am interested in computer science and engineering.

    often pick up a book and start reading it. One of my most favorite author of all time is Paulo Coelho.I am into all sorts of music, I like both mordern and old classic songs. I am also into drawing and mordern arts and I like aesthetic stuffs.
